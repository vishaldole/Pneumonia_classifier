# Pneumonia_classifier
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify X-ray images of lungs as either "pneumonia" or "normal." Pneumonia is a common and potentially life-threatening lung infection, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment.

# Usage
To use this pneumonia classifier, simply provide an X-ray image of a lung, and the model will predict whether it contains signs of pneumonia or not.

# Overview
* Objective: Detect pneumonia in X-ray images.

* Dataset: Utilized a dataset of labeled X-ray images consisting of both pneumonia-positive and normal cases.

* Model: Trained using Teachable Machine, with model weights saved in .h5 files.

* Deployment: The model can be deployed in healthcare settings to assist radiologists in diagnosing pneumonia.
